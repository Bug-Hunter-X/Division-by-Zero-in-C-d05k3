This repository demonstrates a common but dangerous error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version with appropriate error handling.  Division by zero is undefined behavior in C, leading to unpredictable results and potential crashes. Always check for zero divisors before performing division.
